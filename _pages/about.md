I'm Alan Cheng, a master's student at [The University of Hong Kong (HKU)](https://www.hku.hk/), which is ranked 17th in the ​QS 2025 World University Rankings, studying ​Mechanical Engineering. My research interests include deep learning (computer vision, LLMs, and reinforcement learning) and robotics (path planning and positioning).

I am honored to be supervised by [Prof. Peng Lu](https://repository.hku.hk/cris/rp/rp02743) at [ArcLab](https://arclab.hku.hk/), where I am conducting my dissertation project: ​**"Exploration of Unknown Environments with Embedded Semantic Information for UAVs"**.

You can find my CV here:  [Alan's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV.pdf) or [Alan的中文简历](../assets/CV_CN.pdf).

Have fun in my website: [Askme](https://magicspell.net).

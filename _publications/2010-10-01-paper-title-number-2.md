Spiking Neural Network is known as the third-generation artificial neral network whose development has great potential. With the help of Spike Layer Error Reassignment in Time for error back-propagation, this work presents a new network called SpikeGoogle, which is implemented with GoogLeNet-like inception module. In this inception module, different convolution kernels and max-pooling layer are included to capture deep features across diverse scales. Experiment results on small NMNIST dataset verify the results of the authorsâ€™ proposed SpikeGoogle, which outperforms the previous Spiking Convolutional Neural Network method by a large margin.

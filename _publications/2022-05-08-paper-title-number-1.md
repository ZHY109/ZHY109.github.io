This paper presents an integrated framework for autonomous valet parking systems, combining trajectory optimization, reinforcement learning (RL), and traditional path planning. The proposed Preparation and Multi-stage Training with Field Reward (PMT-F) algorithm enhances parking efficiency and robustness in dynamic environments. By integrating the Hybrid A* algorithm with RL and a novel Field Reward function, the PMT-F algorithm improves trajectory optimization and learning convergence. Our results show significant performance improvements in key metrics, establishing a robust foundation for efficient and reliable autonomous valet parking systems.

The PMT-F algorithm achieves superior performance in both vertical and parallel parking scenarios, with success rates of **100%** and **91.4%**, respectively. Its multi-stage training approach and Field Reward function enable effective adaptation to complex environments, outperforming traditional RL methods. This integrated framework demonstrates the potential to revolutionize urban transportation by enhancing parking efficiency and safety.

Paper will be released soon.
